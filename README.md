# marvel_machine_sim
Roll the marvel machine and test your luck! After seeing tons of people waste their hard earned money on trying to defy numbers which do not waver, I decided to code up a simulator so that I too could get the adrenaline rush of losing it all.

Probabilities, images, sound are from the official website.
